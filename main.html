	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in algorithms quantifies the efficiency of an algorithm by measuring how its runtime scales with the input size. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, meaning they can process large inputs quickly.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>, often denoted as O(n), assesses an algorithm's memory usage relative to the input size. It measures how additional storage requirements grow linearly as the input size increases.</p>
